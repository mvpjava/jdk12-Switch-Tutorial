This tutorial supports Blog post "JDK 12 Switch Statements - Preview Feature"
from mvpjava.com

 
This has all been setup for you to run within an official Docker container with access to all the JShell *.jsh script files for you to play around with. 

The environment is totally reproducible by simply executing "run.sh"
after git cloning this repository.


=========================================
Running a .jsh script example from JShell
=========================================

jshell> /open /root/jdkSwitchDemo.jsh


========================================================
When you want to list the code snippets in jshell script
========================================================
jshell> /list


====================================
Executing individual JShell snippets
====================================
jshell>  /list 1


========================================
Exiting JShell and thus Docker Conatiner
========================================
jshell> /exit
